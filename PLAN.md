- Look into more advanced RPC calls
    - Buffer calls?
    - Windows calls?

- Syntax highlighting?
- Autocompletion not working?
    - Probably buffer related

- Remove SessionWrapper
- Remove Q promises

- React perf profiling?
- Refactor out so that other node-based RPC clients can use it

- Get quit working
