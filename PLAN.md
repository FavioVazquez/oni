- Move event to _onVimEvent
- Refactor log events to helper methods
- Refactor render function to helper method
- Refactor the show install help to NeovimEditor

- Will eventually need to decouple the `Services` from individual Neovim instances

- Will need to funnel common plugin manager events to the active editor
